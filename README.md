# 🍃 Guava Disease Detection using CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect diseases in guava leaves based on image classification.

## 🚀 Features
- Image preprocessing
- CNN model for classification
- Flask-based web interface for uploading and predicting
- Displays predicted disease class with confidence score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Flask
- OpenCV
- HTML/CSS (for frontend)
